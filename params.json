{"name":"Conform.","tagline":"A Multithreaded GPL Video Converter","body":"## DISCLAIMER: VERY BUGGY. EVEN THE INSTRUCTIONS MAY BE WRONG.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nI was looking around for a good open source GPL media converter. But every single one I found seemed to be slow and only able to process one file at a time. So I wrote an FFmpeg wrapper that can take on several files at once. Enjoy! And report any bugs you find so that I can fix them. :)\r\n\r\n# Building Instructions\r\nThis project has only been tested to work on Linux (Linux Mint 17) and is unlikely to work on any other OS at the moment. It project requires Qt5, FFmpeg, and jsoncpp. The following commands should have you covered:\r\n```\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get qtdeclarative5-dev cmake ffmpeg\r\ngit clone https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp.git\r\ncd jsoncpp\r\ncmake .\r\nmake && sudo make install\r\n```\r\nNow, onto building it:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/aborsim/Conform.git\r\ncd Conform\r\nqmake .\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
